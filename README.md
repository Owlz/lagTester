# Overview
Really not too much to this. I needed a means to check the lag time of my gamepad (and HDMI) so this is a simple python script to do just that. You play a little game where you press your x (or similar) button when the screen goes green to test the lag time.

# Install
As per usual, you probably want to be installing things into a python virtual environment. Up to you.

```bash
$ pip install lagTester
```

# Use 
```bash
$ lagTester
```

Should be self explanatory.

# Works On/Testing
I threw this together quickly. It __should__ work on both python2 and python3 as well as most Linux and Windows distributions. It's only been tested using python 3 on Windows and Ubuntu. Also, it has only been tested with an XBOX360 controller. Again, __should__ work with other controllers, but who knows. If it doesn't work with yours, fix it and submit a PR. Or -- buy me the controller and I'll get it working ;-)
